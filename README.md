# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help Louise increase her chances for a successful Kickstarter campaign for her play.  Data were examined from 4,114 worldwide Kickstarter campaigns, 1,066 of which were plays.  In this study, two factors are studied to evaluate the impact on campaign success -- the campaign launch date and the funding goals.  Results are provided in tabular and chart form. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The success of theater campaigns was analyzed based upon the month in which the campaign was launch.  There were more successful campaigns launch in May (111) and June (100) than in other months (average 63).  The success rate of May (67%) and June (65%) were also higher than other months (average 59%).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next the success of the theater campaigns was studied based upon the funding goal.  The data show differences in success rates based upon the amount of the funding goal.  The most successful campaigns had goals in the following ranges:  Less than $1k (76%), $1k-<$5k (73%), $35k-<$40k (67%), and $40k-<$45k (67%).  While the success rate is similar, the number of successful campaigns in each these ranges varied substantially:  Less than $1k (141), $1k-<$5k (388), $35k-<$40k (4), and $40k-<$45k (2).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I anticipated a challenge of nesting various COUNTIF formulas to calculate the success rate for various theater campaigns in various funding ranges.  However, learning the COUNTIFS formula greatly simplified the process and I anticipate this being useful in summarizing and analyzing data in the future.

## Results

### Outcomes based on launch date

Based upon the analysis, I can conclude that if the campaign were launched in May, it would maximize the potential for success.  The data show that those campaigns launched in May had both the highest success rate and the highest number of successful campaigns.  By both measures, June was the next most successful month.

On the other hand, if the campaign were launched in the fall and winter months, it would minimize the potential for success.  Most months from September to March had low number of successful campaigns and generally lower success rates.

### Outcomes based on goals

Based upon the outcomes based on goal, it seems to be important that the goal be set appropriately.  If a campaign fails to meet its goal, no money pledged is received.  Thus, setting a goal that maximizes the potential for success is important.  Itâ€™s also good to note that if the goal is surpassed, the additional funds will be received.  Thus, I can conclude that setting the goal less than $5,000 greatly increases the chances of being successful.  Although more money may be desired, if the goal is set too high and not achieved, no money will be gained. Thus, I would suggest finding ways to trim expenses to bring the budget in line with other successful Kickstarter plays.

### Limitations of dataset

This analysis was performed based upon data encompassing 4,114 worldwide Kickstarter campaigns, 1,066 of which were plays.  The launch dates range from 2009 to 2017 and thus may no longer represent campaign experiences well.  The analysis is based upon past performance and experiences during and after the pandemic may differ.  The analysis did not attempt to compare other aspects of campaigns (such as the content of the play, geographical location, expected audience, etc.).  

### Other potential analysis

Other data that could be analyzed include average donation per backer and any change in success rates over the years.  One interesting analysis that could provide meaningful guidance would be to examine how close failed campaigns had come to meeting their goal.  For example, if a campaign fell just short of their goal, they would not receive any funding.  If their goal, however, had been set lower, they may have received the majority of their ask.
